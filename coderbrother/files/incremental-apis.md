# API

API (Application Programming Interface) acts as interface for communication which enabled different systems or applications to communicate with each other.

For example, when you use **Ryanair app**, it communicates with **web services** which serves data via an API to loads **a list of available routes**.

---
# API

The term API can be used in the context of various communication channels:
- Web APIs
- Library APIs
- Operating System APIs

We will focus on the Web APIs.

---
# Web API

A Web API:
- is an interface that allows applications or services to communicate with each other 
- enables developers to integrate functionality, exchange data, or interact with external services

---
# Web API Key Characteristics

- Communication Over HTTP/HTTPS
- Request/Response Model
- Endpoints

---
# Frontend vs Backend

We typically use Web APIs in the context of web development, which encompasses both frontend and backend development.

**Frontend is described by web applications and mobile apps.**
**Backend is describer by the back-end system serving data.**

We will examine the communication between the frontend, represented by a website, and the backend, represented by a RESTful API service.

---
# Web API types

- RESTful APIs 
  - the most widely used 
  - rely on standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - stateless
  - various data formats: JSON, XML

- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) APIs
  - formalized
  - described by XML-based messaging protocol

---
# Web API types

- GraphQL APIs
  - based on query language which allows to retrieve exact data specified by consumer
  - structure defined by the client

- WebSocket APIs
  - enable two-way communication
  - reduced latency

---
# HTTP

- foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web
- protocol used for transmitting resources between a client (like a browser) and a server
- based on Request-Response Model
- stateless protocol, each request is independent

---
# HTTP

### HTTP Request
Contains a method (GET, POST, etc.), URL, headers, and sometimes a body (for POST requests).

### HTTP Response
Contains a status code (like 200 for success or 404 for "not found"), headers, and the requested content (like HTML).

---
# HTTP Methods

- **GET**: retrieves data from the server
- **POST**: sends data to the server (usually to create or update a resource)
- **PUT**: updates an existing resource on the server
- **DELETE**: removes a resource from the server

---
# HTTP Status Codes

- **200 OK**: successful request
- **404 Not Found**: resource not found
- **500 Internal Server Error**: server-side error

---
# JSON

- lightweight data-interchange format
- easy for humans to read and write
- easy for machines to parse and generate
- widely used in web development to transmit data between services
- organizes data into key-value pairs
- language agnostic

---
# JSON

```
{
    "firstName": "Maciej",
    "lastName": "Gowin",
    "phone": {
        "callingCode": "48",
        "number": "693142041"
    },
    "height": 180,
    "dateOfBirth": "1986-11-21",
    "roles": [
        "developer",
        "mentor",
        "lecturer
    ]
}
```

---
# RESTful API

- describes resources via URI
  - http://api.coderbrother.pl/customers for list of customers
- available operations defined by the HTTP verbs
  - GET to retrieve resource
- result of the operation defined by the HTTP status codes
  - 200 if operation was successful
- data described by common format
  - i.e. JSON
- stateless
  - each request is independent, information is not shared between requests

---
# RESTful API Example

| Operation | Resource            | Description        |
|:----------|:--------------------|:-------------------|
| GET       | /customers          | retrieve customers |
| GET       | /customers/{teamId} | retrieve customers |
| POST      | /customers          | create customers   |
| PUT       | /customers/{teamId} | update customers   |
| DELETE    | /customers/{teamId} | delete customers   |

---
# RESTful API example

```
GET https://api.coderbrother.pl/customers/abcd-1234
Header: Content-Type: application/json
```

```
Status: 200
Header: Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
  "id": "abcd-1234",
  "name": "Maciej Gowin"
}
```

---
# API evolution

- API evolves and may require changes
- API requires incremental changes

---
# API evolution

Consider changes:

- What if we want to add date of birth to an existing API?
- What if we want to split the name and return separated first and last name?

---
# API evolution

### Add date of birth to the model - backward compatibility met

Additive changes are acceptable as long as they do not break existing contract.

```
GET https://api.coderbrother.pl/customers/abcd-1234
```

```
{
  "id": "abcd-1234",
  "name": "Maciej Gowin",
  "dateOfBirth": "1986-11-21"
}
```

---
# API backward compatibility

### Replace name with first and last name - backward compatibility not met

Breaking changes define new model.

```
GET https://api.coderbrother.pl/newCustomers/abcd-1234
```

```
{
  "id": "abcd-1234",
  "firstName": "Maciej",
  "lastName": "Gowin"
}
```

---
# API backward compatibility

For incremental changes, we will implement API versioning when a new model is defined for an existing resource.

As an example:

```
GET https://api.coderbrother.pl/v1/customer/abcd-1234
GET https://api.coderbrother.pl/v2/customer/abcd-1234
```

---
# API versioning

### URI Versioning
```
/v1/customer/abcd-1234
```

### Query Parameter Versioning
```
/customer/abcd-1234?version=1
```

---
# API versioning

### Header Versioning
```
/customer/abcd-1234

With a header:
Accept: application/vnd.api.v1+json
```

### Subdomain Versioning

```
v1.api.coderbrother.pl/customer/abcd-1234
v2.api.coderbrother.pl/customer/abcd-1234
```

---
# Choosing a Versioning Strategy

### Clarity
How easily can users understand the versioning scheme? 

### Flexibility
Does the versioning method allow for easy changes and updates?

### Backward Compatibility
How well does the versioning approach support clients using older versions of the API?

### Simplicity
Is the versioning method simple to implement and maintain?

---
# When API Can Be Deprecated?

- different approach driven by the consumer: mobile vs web
- unused versions can be removed
- use of tracing tools to verify the API usage

---
# API vs Sprints

The API must be defined before frontend work begins, which undermines the principle of delivering functionality from the ground up during sprints.

---
# Incremental API

### Backend ahead of Frontend

API implementation starts one sprint before.

### Model agreement

The team agrees on the API model and works in accordance with it. Model can be defined using tools such as Swagger.

### Mocking
Quick API mocks representing the model. Mocks are delivered by tools such as Mockoon or JSON Server

---
# APIs vs Agile Methodologies

API planning and versioning for incremental changes are crucial from a technical point of view.

However, there are other challenges to API work in the context of Agile methodologies.

---
# 1. Defining Clear Requirements

### Challenge
Translating business requirements into API user stories is tricky since APIs often donâ€™t interface directly with users. 

### Solution
Collaborate with product owners to create technical stories and clarify the business value.

---
# 2. Incremental Delivery

### Challenge
Delivering usable API increments each sprint is hard, especially when endpoints are interdependent.

### Solution
Prioritize high-value endpoints and start with a minimal viable API (MVA).

---
# 3. Versioning and Backward Compatibility

### Challenge
Frequent changes can break existing clients, making backward compatibility a concern.

### Solution
Use versioning strategies and plan for backward compatibility in every sprint.

---
# 4. Managing Dependencies

### Challenge
Coordinating between teams (frontend, backend) can delay progress.

### Solution
Use API contracts and mock services to unblock teams.

---
# 5. Non-functional Requirements (NFRs)

### Challenge
Addressing performance, security, and scalability in short sprints can be tough.

### Solution
Plan NFRs into sprint work and conduct performance and security tests regularly.

---
# 6. Testing and Automation

### Challenge
Thoroughly testing and automating API tests in each sprint is time-consuming.

### Solution
Automate unit, integration, and performance tests using CI/CD pipelines.

---
# 7. Documentation

### Challenge
Keeping API documentation up-to-date in fast-paced sprints is difficult.

### Solution
Use automated tools (Swagger) to generate documentation alongside development.

---
# 8. Managing Technical Debt

### Challenge
Rapid delivery can lead to technical debt, degrading API quality over time.

### Solution
Allocate time in sprints for refactoring and technical improvements.

---
# 9. Coordinating Release Cycles

### Challenge
Releasing new API versions must align with consumers (frontend, mobile) to avoid disruptions.

### Solution
Use feature flags and communicate with teams to synchronize releases.

---
# 10. Changing Requirements

### Challenge
Constant requirement changes can lead to design instability.

### Solution
Use flexible API design patterns and maintain clear communication with stakeholders.
